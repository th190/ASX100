## Stock Market Prediction using Sequence to Sequence Learning

### Introduction
This repo contains the data and implementation for the DSA4199 Honour Project: Stock Market Prediction using Sequence to Sequence Learning

### Requirements
1. python=3.7.6
2. numpy=1.19.2
3. pandas=1.2.1
4. ta-lib=0.4.19
5. scikit-learn=0.23.2
6. matplotlib=3.3.2

### Files
The models implemented in models.py. The model training can be done by running the 4 jupyter notebook:
1. MLP.ipynb
2. lstm-gru-rnnmodel.ipynb
3. seq2seq.ipynb
4. attn-seq2seq.ipynb

The evaluation and trading test results/plots can be recreated by running eval.ipynb and trading.ipynb.
